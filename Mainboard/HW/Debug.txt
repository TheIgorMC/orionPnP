3V3 RAIL NOT WORKING [FIXED]
- Replaced R_high on the 3v3 buck to ensure it was 100k, still not turning to 3v3
- Tried to feed 3V3 from the rail to check FB voltage, spot on at 600mV (precisely what the SY chip needs)
- Tried increasing output capacitance to compensate for suboptimal performance of the 2x22uF caps but not resolving
- Fixed placement of BS capacitor C12, now across pins 5-6. Fixed the issue.

USB HUB NOT DETECTED [FIXED]
- Placed the correct 19k2 resistor on pin 1 to GND to fix the issue. Still not enumerating on windows

USB HUB NOT ENUMERATING [FIXED]
- Cut traces of SSTX to the hub and placed 100nF capacitors in series (LCSC code: C1525 / OrionID: 52), fixed the issue, hub working.

USB NOT WORKING ON STM32
- Adjusted settings for flash to make sure PLL is working at intended frequency, fixed the issue, USB COM port now working properly.
