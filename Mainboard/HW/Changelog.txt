[NP] = Not produced
[NW] = Not working after testing


[0.2a]
- Fixed USB hub connections, added capacitors to SSTX and resistor to R1 pin
- Added filtering RC to GND on USB connectors shells
- Switched buck converter to different model to fix Issues in 3V3 rail
- Changed buck converter input to be 12V instead of 5V for better efficency
- Rerouted USBSS signals for newly added capacitors
- Changed fuse holders for Issues in soldering (hard to solder SMD in limited space, THT should be better)
- Added power LED on 3V3 rail (should not light up if 12V off, which means 24V is off, which means board is off?)

[0.1c] [NP]
- Fixed capacitor C50 footprint being not visible

[0.1b] [NW]
- Fixed some layout Issues
- Added 2D matrix for traceability

[0.1a] [NP]
- Initial revision of board
