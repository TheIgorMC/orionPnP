[NP] = Not produced
[NW] = Not working after testing


[0.2a]
- Changed USB hub chip to VSON variant for better availability
- Fixed USB hub connections, added capacitors to SSTX and resistor to R1 pin
- Added filtering RC to GND on USB connectors shells
- Rerouted USBSS signals for newly added capacitors
- Fixed bootstrap capacitor being placed across the wrong pins causing 3v3 to never come up
- Changed fuse holders for Issues in soldering (hard to solder SMD in limited space, THT should be better)
- Added power LED on 3V3 rail (should not light up if 5V off, which means 12V is off, which means board is off?)
- Added Test Points on most crucial signals

[0.1c] [NP]
- Fixed capacitor C50 footprint being not visible

[0.1b]
- Fixed some layout Issues
- Added 2D matrix for traceability

[0.1a] [NP]
- Initial revision of board
